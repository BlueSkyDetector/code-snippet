I made zabbix_get.sh and zabbix_top.sh without zabbix_get binary only using bash, cut, od and sleep.
It might be useful sometime, though it's a joke software.

usage: zabbix_get.sh -s <host name or IP> [-p <port>] -k <key>
usage: zabbix_top.sh 'host1 host2 host3 ...' <refresh_rate(0-9)> <debug(0|1)>
